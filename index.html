			<p> My name is Stephen Rainford. My major is Digital Media: content strategies. I am a junior and this is my second year on campus at northwest; I am in Dungeons and bearcats which is the campus's DnD club and through that club I have met lifelong friends and developed a passtime I never planned on joining. In my freetime I also play Disc golf at the course on campus.</p>
